# Predicting the Success of Rental Ads in the German Rental Market


### General Information 

In this project, we are building a model that aims to predict how successful online rental ads are, given numerous apartment attributes. So far, there are two possible ways to measure an ad's success: 

1. The duration time of the ad being online, as it can be assumed that taking an ad offline is closely linked to the successful renting of the respective appartment
2. The number of clicks on the respective ad.

### Data

We identified two datasets seem appropriate: First, the replication dataset of [Breidenbach/Schaffner (2020)](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/ger-2019-0126/html?lang=en) which covers data from the biggest German rental ad platform (Immobilienscout24) in the period from 2007 and 2020. The second possible data set is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/corrieaar/apartment-rental-offers-in-germany).

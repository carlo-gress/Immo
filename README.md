# Predicting the Lifespan of Online Listings in the German Housing Market


### General Information 

This research project that should allow us to gain first hand experience with the methods, challenges and possibilities of the machine learning pipeline. In order to achieve this, we will implement a prediction task with a number of different model architectures, hyper-parameters and methods. Correspondingly, this project falls under categories 1 and 5 of the project types described in the document titled \textit{Guidance Notes for Final Projects}: applying an existing ML model to a new task or problem and experimental and/or theoretical analysis of machine learning models. From a theoretical perspective, our project falls in the supervised learning paradigm

The project's main use case will be predicting the lifespan of online listings in the German housing market. Specifically, we will use listing features from a large dataset to predict how long these housing offers stay online. The dataset in question includes a good number of interesting listing features which will allow us to explore ancillary questions that should allow us to explore how changing specific parameters in our models produce different performance results. Just to mention an example, we will try using balanced and unbalanced training sets to explore how these different approaches affect different performance metrics.

### Data

We identified two datasets seem appropriate: First, the replication dataset of [Breidenbach/Schaffner (2020)](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/ger-2019-0126/html?lang=en) which covers data from the biggest German rental ad platform (Immobilienscout24) in the period from 2007 and 2020. The second possible data set is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/corrieaar/apartment-rental-offers-in-germany).
